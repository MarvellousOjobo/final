   Congratulations! You did it. You completed your HTML course on the Teaching Young Coders(TYC) platform but remember it doesn't end here, there are many HTML tags but we only discussed the basics. So try checking more resources to check out more HTML elements. The tags may be too many to memorize but remember the more you code with them, the lesser your chances of forgetting these tags so CODE ON! Also remember to proceed to your CSS course and then JavaScript to become a worthy frontend developer but aside that there are also backend development courses like PHP e.t.c if you want to be a full stack web developer. We would create more updates with more courses. So once again CODE ON!
