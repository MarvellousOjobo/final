   <h1>ADDING IMAGES TO WEBPAGES</h1>
  <p>HTML has a way of adding images to webpages. Thats why you can see pictures on the web. Now you are going to learn how to do that. Sounds cool right?</p>
  <p>Now the steps;
   <ul>
    <li>STEP 1:Create a folder with any name e.g TYC.</li>
    <li>STEP 2:Add any image of your choice into the folder.</li>
    <li>STEP 3:Rename the image without erasing the image extension e.g .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .svg. You can name the image anything e.g marvel.png</li> 
    <li>STEP 4:Create a HTML file and save it in the folder you created.</li>
    <li>STEP 5:In your HTML code input this code, (The space between the tag sign and the img was given to avoid the code from running so your code shouldnt't have it.)< img src="The image name and extension."/> i.e for the  folder I created my code would be like this < img src="marvel.png"/></li>
    <li>STEP 6:Now give the image a width and height e.g < img src="marvel.png" width="500px" height="500px"/></li>
    <li>STEP 7: Run your code and put a smile on your face because you should be seeing your picture on the screen</li>
   </ul>
    If it does not work try creating a sub-folder in the TYC folder and paste your image in the sub-folder then input this code intead, < img src="sub-folder/image name and extension"/> e.g < img src="Images/marvel.png" width="500px" height="500px"/>
