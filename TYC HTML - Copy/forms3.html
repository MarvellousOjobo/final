   <h1>FORM ATTRIBUTES</h1>
   We have learnt about attributes and table attributes but forms also have special attributes that help it function better. There are three(3) atributes that we have considered important which are ;
 <ul>
  <li>required.</li>
  <li>readonly.</li>
  <li>placeholder.</li>
 </ul> 
   <h3>Required attribute</h3>
    <p>It is used tell HTML that data must be entered in the input field that the attribute is attached to.</p>
    EXAMPLE
    <br/>
     < form>
    <br/> 
    < input type="text" required>
	<br/>
    < input type="submit" value="SUBMIT">
     </form>
    <br/>
  OUTPUT
    <form>
    <input type="text" required>
    <input type="submit" value="SUBMIT">
     </form>
    Now try clicking on the SUBMIT button without entering any data in the field and see what happens.
    <br/>
    <h3>Readonly attribute</h3>
	<p>It creates an input field which does not accept data input. It may seem useless but in cases were you're creating things like a calculator were data is not entered but the numbers are being clicked and they appear in the input field.</p>
	EXAMPLE
	 <br/>
	< input type="password" readonly>
	 <br/>
	<input type="password" readonly>
	<br/>
	Now data cannot be entered in the input field.
	 <br/>
      <h3>Placeholder attribute</h3>
       <p>It is used to tell the user what to input in the input field.</p>
       EXAMPLE
	<br/>
	< input type="password" placeholder="Please enter your password">
	<br/>
	<input type="password" placeholder="Please enter your password">
	<br/>
	Now in the example, there is a text in the input box telling the user to input his/her password.
