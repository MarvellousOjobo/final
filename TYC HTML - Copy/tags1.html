   <h1>HTML TAGS</h1>
    <p>Remember, I said HTML is a markup language which uses tags to perform certain functions. The tags help HTML understand what function you want it to perform</p>
    <p>As we all know, everything having a beginning also has an ending. HTML also follows this principle on most of its tags.</p>
    <b>NOTE: Please note that HTML tags do not have the period(fullstop) sign in between them as it was displayed in the below examples, the period sign was put to prevent the tags from running as part of the code.</b>
  <h3>HTML TAG EXAMPLES</h3>
