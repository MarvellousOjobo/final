   <h1>HTML COMMENTS</h1>
    <p>In common sense, a comment is a spoken remark of an action. Now this also applies to HTML.</p>
    <p>In HTML a comment is a part of the code which tells another person reading your code what that part of the code is all about. It is not outputted with the rest of the code rather it only shows what the code in that part is all about. A comment can be put anywhere and as many times in a code</p>

   <div class="hint">
	MARVEL: Remember, HTML comments are not shown in the output, they just help code readers understand your code better. They can be put anywhere and as many times as you want in a code.
