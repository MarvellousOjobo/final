  <h1>WORKING WITH TEXT EDITORS</h1>
  <p>Text editors are programs which help us convert our HTML code into useful output that appears  as our website. Over the years many text editors have been developed such as NOTEPAD, SUBLIME TEXT EDITOR, DCODER, QUICKEDIT, e.t.c.</p>
  <p>To run a HTML file you have to save the file with an extension which is .html or .htm</p>
  When your code is run,you can see the output as it would show on the web.
