    <h1>HTML COLORS.</h1>
     <p>In the beginning of this HTML course, I remember saying that CSS is using for styling webpages which includes giving it colors but HTML also has a way of applying colors to its elements. HTML uses hexadecimal values to create its colors.
      These hexadecimal values include 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F. Now a combination of these characters create colors with which HTML uses to give its elements colors. The hexadecimal values of HTML colors could be researched and a hash sign is used to start the color value e.g white is #ffffff or #fff while black is #000000 or #000.  
    <div class="hint">
     MARVEL: There are many hexadecimal color combinations but with constant practice you could be able to learn many of the combination.
