    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the core language for making websites. HTML is Hypertext in the sense that websites are written in Hyper text and it is a markup language such that it is made up by using tags which perform certain functions. Don't worry, you will learn about tags in upcoming lessons.
          <p>Learning web development is almost the same thing as learning HTML but how we all need support to do certain things, HTML gets support from other languages like CSS and Javascript.There are other languages for web development but these are the major ones.</p>
