     <p>You may be confused by now but not to worry, by the time you are done with this course, you would be able to write codes longer than this. Trust me.
      This is why we say HTML is a markup language, It is made up of tags.

     <div class="hint">
	MARVEL:Study the code because this is the foundation of every HTML code. Don't worry it would be explained in upcoming lessons.
