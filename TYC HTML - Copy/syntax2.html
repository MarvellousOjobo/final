   Okay so now we're going to analyze the code displayed earlier.
  	<P>Before we begin I would like to introduce the fact that the arrangement of a HTML code can be likened to that of a ham burger. YES A HAM BURGER,you have the two buns above and below and the ham in between with some other things stuffed inside.</P>
      <p>In the code displayed earlier,ther are three(3) important tags that we need to analyze.</p>
     <ul>
	<li>THE HTML TAG</li>
        <li>THE HEAD TAG</li>
	 <li>THE BODY TAG</li>
     </ul>
